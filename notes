Ideas for analysis
- if we were able to improve our percentage loss (from 10% to 5%), say thanks to better installations/warehouse facilities, how much would we be willing to pay for these? 
- what if we could only buy/sell integer values of materials?

Darcie
- selling price sensitivity
- copper price sensitivity
- prod capacity sensitivity

Ali
- scenario analysis for blending
- for loop
- reduced costs

things to consider
- commenting code
- changing r_r to y_r
- in the notes for wk1, he has a 'production plan' after optimal solution - should we include?
- with the proportion constraints - have we overexplained? could we do it differently?
